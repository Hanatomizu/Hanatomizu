### Hello!

This is __**モモサワホシゾラ**__, you can also call me __**Hanatomizu**__  
I am a student with **depression**, so I'm afraid with **Social**   
Now, I'm learning C++ and Python, hope you can like my programs.

#### About me
I am a normal student in the world, just loves coding.  
I usually do the problems on [Leetcode](leetcode.com) [Luogu](luogu.com.cn) and [codeforces](codeforces.com).  
I'm the computer manager of our class (and also the subject representative of English language).
Well, it look so boring, but I will make it better in the future.

#### My Orgnazation

It's even not a orgnazation, it named **__Project DreamTeam__**.
There's only 2 members in the orgnazation (me and my classmate who is interested in coding).
