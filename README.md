**Hello there, this is Hanatomizu. Nice to meet you! $꒰ᐢ⸝⸝•༝•⸝⸝ᐢ꒱ $ **

I'm currently learning $C/C++$ myself and preparing for the contest. Maybe I would develop a mini program later, I'm not sure. $(ᕑᗢᓫ∗)˒$

The $Dynamic \ Planning$ is too difficult  $QAQ$

This is a anime lover, so I'm also learning Japanese, but I too lazy to memorize the words and the grammar.~~Therefore I learnt nothing so far~~ $(。•́︿•̀。)$

Therefore, **kaibai** is right
